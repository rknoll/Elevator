## Elevator Project

To setup the Project files for an IDE, just run

```
./gradlew eclipse
```

or

```
./gradlew idea
```

to automatically generate them. Then just import that project into your IDE. If you're using a Gradle Plugin for Eclipse or IntelliJ IDEA 14, you can directly import the build.gradle File as Project.
